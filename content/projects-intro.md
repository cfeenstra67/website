Here you can find some descriptions of some of the projects I've worked on--the motivation behind them, how they're deployed, and other associated notes. All of these are side projects I've tackled in my side time based on ideas I've come up with, so their code may vary in quality, but all of it can be found on github--links to associated repos can be found in each item below.
