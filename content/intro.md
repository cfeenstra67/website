My name is Cam Feenstra, and I am a software engineer. I use this website to write about my projects and interests. I'm a self-taught programmer, and I'm most interested in working on the most difficult problems I can find. Professionally, I'm currently working on helping business manage their risk and run more efficiently at [Anzen](https://www.anzen.com) in San Francisco.

My interests within the software field are pretty broad; I love writing code, and I've done work on many parts of the software stack: writing frontends, developing APIs, implementing data pipelines, setting up cloud infrastructure, and even training machine learning models.

I use this site mainly to post projects I've worked on outside of work, but I've also posted links to recordings of some talks I've given about building software on top of large language models. Sometimes I also just have an idea I can't get out of my head, and I write a blog post about it here. If you're interested, check out the [posts](/posts) and [projects](/projects) pages to learn more.

I also try to spend plenty of time not on the computer, whether that be travelling, hiking, biking, kayaking, or just hanging around outside. During the winter I also love skiing. The image of me above is from a trip I took with my amazing girlfriend to Greece in August 2023.
