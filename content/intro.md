My name is Cam Feenstra, and I am a software engineer. I use this website to write about my projects and interests. I'm a self-taught programmer, and I'm most interested in working on the most difficult problems I can find. Professionally, I'm currently working on helping business manage their risk and run more efficiently at [Anzen](https://www.anzen.com) in San Francisco.

My interests within the field of technology are fairly broad, but I'm particularly interested in managing cloud infrastructure and more generally developer tools. In 2021 a few [blog posts](/posts) about infrastructure as code after spending a few months last year building my own tool called [statey](https://github.com/cfeenstra67/statey)!

I also try to spend plenty of time not on the computer, whether that be hiking, biking, kayaking, or just hanging around outside. During the winter I also love skiing. The image of me above is from a trip I took with my family to hike the Inca Trail in Peru in 2018 (has it been that long already? I should probably update that photo... a job for another day).
