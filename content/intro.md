My name is Cam Feenstra, and I am a software engineer. I use this website to write about my projects and interests. I'm a self-taught programmer, and I'm most interested in working on the most difficult problems I can find. Professionally, I'm currently working on helping sales teams perform better at [People.ai](https://people.ai) in San Francisco.

My interests within the field of technology are fairly broad, but I'm particularly interested in managing cloud infrastructure and more generally developer tools. I've recently written a few [blog posts](/posts) about infrastructure as code after spending a few months last year building my own tool called [statey](https://github.com/cfeenstra67/statey)!

Outside of building software, I love to be outside! In the summer I particularly like hiking, biking, and kayaking. The image of me above is from a trip I took with my family to hike the Inca Trail in Peru in 2018. I love skiing in the winter as well!
