My name is Cam Feenstra. I am a software engineer, currently working for People.ai in San Francisco. I use this website to write about my projects and interests. I'm a self-taught programmer, and I'm most interested in working on the most difficult problems I can find.

My interests within the field of technology are fairly broad, but I'm particularly interested in developer tools. Check out the blog post I wrote about [how infrastructure-as-code tools work](/posts/how-infra-as-code-works) after spending a few last year building [statey](https://github.com/cfeenstra67/statey)!
