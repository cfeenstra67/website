My name is Cam Feenstra, and I am a software engineer. I use this website to write about my projects and interests. I'm a self-taught programmer, and I'm most interested in working on the most difficult problems I can find. Professionally, I'm currently working on helping sales teams perform better at [People.ai](https://people.ai) in San Francisco.

My interests within the field of technology are fairly broad, but I'm particularly interested in developer tools. Check out the blog post I wrote about [how infrastructure-as-code tools work](/posts/how-infra-as-code-works) after spending a few months last year building [statey](https://github.com/cfeenstra67/statey)!
