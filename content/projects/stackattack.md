Stackattack is a library of high-level infrastructure components aimed at helping users put working infrastructure stacks together quickly using AWS and Pulumi. Infra as code tools are amazing, but getting things set up initially is frequently a source of pain, and surprisingly few resources are available with fully-working configs for common needs. I created Stackattack to help address this problem--you can use it as a library, or simple as a set of working examples that you can copy + paste to get started on your own.

For more information about the motivation behind Stackattack, check out my [introductory blog post](/posts/infra-as-code-takes-too-much-code).
